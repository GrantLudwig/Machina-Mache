## Problem Statement
We were originally tasked with tackling the problem of data dignity by creating a product or system that helped users to maintain control of their data. Currently, companies mostly have free reign over peoples data that they easily collect and can predict from our actions on thier platforms. Many people today have surrendered to the fact that companies have data on us and are using it for thier own economic gain, with no benefits to us.

We aim to create a product that will allow people to better understand what thier data is being used for and where it ends up. Our main goal is to de-stigmatize Big Data and provide ethical avenues for companies/researchers to collect data. Through brainstorming ideas and multiple interviews with potential users, we created Machina Máche.

## Project Description
We have designed two platforms for both of our different user bases. A desktop webstite for companies looking for a ethical way to obtain data where they can create requests for data. We also created a mobile app for ordinary people to fulfill requests and potentially get compensated for their efforts.

## Context
This project was created as a part of the User Experience Design course at Seattle University, offered Spring Quarter 2019 through the Computer Science department.

Our group ended up on this idea after reading about an idea similar to ours in a paper called *A Blueprint for a Better Digital Society* by Jaron Lanier and E. Glen Weyl. We all agreed how companies obtained data from users is in a morally gray area and we wanted to find a better way for comapies to obtain data from users, without bascially stealing it from them. Thus we began creating Machina Máche.

### App Mock-up
#### Login and Create Account
This is the login and create account screens of our application. Here the user can login to thier account or if they are a new user, they can create an account. Once they are signed in our have completed sign in they will go to the Home screen.

#### Home
This is the home screen, the main feature of our app. From this screen a user can look at all the requests they qualify for. From this screen the user can open the menu to go to the my account screen, fulfilled screen, and logout. They can also go to notifications in the top right. If they would like to learn more about a request, they can touch the box with the request and the request expands into the screen next to the default home screen. Once expanded a user can read the full terms or go to select photos for the request.

#### Request Fulfillment
The first screen shows what will show up when you come to after choosing to select photos from a request. This displays all the photos in your camera roll (which the app will permissions for) which you can select for the request. This screen has been vastly redone because of feedback. We were told the old version had too much on it and it would be simplier to just fully integrate the camera roll into selection. Off of that feedback, we created this new designed screen. Once a user selects the photos they want to send, they can touch send which will display the below popup. After they confirm sending, the last below popup will display on the home screen.

#### App Camera
This is the app camera. Here a user can take photos for a request. Also if the company requires, for example, an eye picture in a specific part of the photo, the app will display a box for the user to focus their eye into. The second screen displays the pictures that you have taken with the camera. Once a user leaves the page, the new pictures will display on the camera roll.

#### My Account
This screen displays a users information. The user can change thier username, email, and password. From this screen the user can also link their bank information or Venmo (do not know if actually possible) for payment.

#### Fulfilled
This screen displays all of a users past requests that they have fulfilled. If touched on, it will expand displaying the information about the request.

#### Notifications
This screen is where all notifications for a user are located. This is also another goal of our app, which is to give users updates on how thier data is being used. The four different notification types are displayed below and when one is opened it will go to a new screen with the full information from the notification.
